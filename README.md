#Implement session variables.
#For every failed login attempt, keep track of it in a session variable (using an array). 
#There should be a button on index.php that will display all the previous attempts (the form will have a submit button and a report button). 
#If username and password is correct then take them to welcome.php and display their correct username/password with current date (formatted in a readable way). 
#Set session variable authenticated to true. If this is true, skip login page when refreshing. 
#Create a logout page that sets authenticated to false.
